Quadtree its a structure, that consist of squares
Big Square must be N*N elements, where N is a power of two, enter N:
Its cool!
Now enter matrix N*N:
The matrix that could be read:
1 2 3 4 4 4 4 4 
8 7 6 5 4 4 4 4 
0 9 8 7 4 4 4 4 
3 4 5 6 4 4 4 4 
1 2 3 4 3 3 7 8 
8 7 6 5 3 3 2 1 
0 9 8 7 6 5 1 1 
3 4 5 6 7 8 1 1
